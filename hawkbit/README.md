# hawkbit

Client side API to interact with [Eclipse hawkBit](https://www.eclipse.org/hawkbit/).

So far only the [Direct Device Integration API](https://www.eclipse.org/hawkbit/apis/ddi_api/)
is implemented. See [this example](https://github.com/collabora/hawkbit-rs/blob/main/hawkbit/examples/polling.rs)
demonstrating how to use it.
